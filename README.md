# RS-Lang

## The following technologies were involved in the development process:

- TypeScript

Pros: The type system increases the code quality, readability and makes it easy to maintain and refactor codebase. More importantly, errors can be caught at compile time rather than at runtime.
Cons: It takes more time to write the code, since it is necessary to describe all the involved interfaces, types, and method signatures.

- Bootstrap

Bootstrap is a tool that allows you to quickly create a website from building blocks. This is both its advantage and its disadvantage - you can quickly get a high-quality site, while losing originality.

- Sass

Pros: It is a CSS extension with which designers and developers can work much more efficiently and faster. It can use the nesting syntax and useful features such as color manipulation, math, and other values.
Cons: The developer will need some time to study the possibilities of the preprocessor

- ะก3.js

C3.js is a good charting library that is easy to add to a web page. You won't notice a problem in a simple example, but the browser takes over 100ms to render and layout your page, C3.js will noticeably render very slowly.
